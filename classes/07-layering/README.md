## Assignment
- Choose a place. It could be a real place or an imaginary place. Create a layered soundscape that gives the feeling of being in this space. It could be a literal space, like an office, or an emotional space, like meditation or anxiety. Think about the different layers of sounds that you're likely to find in a space like this. Think about the different sonic domains that these sounds occupy. 
- Remember close, medium, far. Specific or general, noisy or harmonic.
- Your handed-in assignment can be a fixed piece (sound arranged in a DAW), or it can be a Max patch that generates the sound procedurally.
