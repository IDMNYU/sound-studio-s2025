# Class 2
- Show how to play back an audio file using sfplay~
- Show how to record audio files using Audacity
  - Obviously people can use whatever they want to record audio files, but we'll all have access to Audacity.
- Show how to edit audio files, find zero crossings, etc.
- Experiment with creating textures and rhythms.

## TODO
- Plugins and instruments that make heavy use of sampling? Relate what we're doing in class to instruments that people use IRL?

## Assignment

- Choose a sample to loop, this will be the ostinato, the foundation of the composition.
- Record original audio files (or use the ones that we provide)
- Make a layered composition in Max that you can control using sliders and toggles
- Think about the overall arc of the piece, beginning + middle + end.
