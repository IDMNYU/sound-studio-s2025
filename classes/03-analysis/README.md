# Class 3
- Partials, vibrating strings, overtone series
- Break down sounds using SPEAR, show the decomposition.
- Fundamental, partials, etc.
- Additive synthesis to synthesize bell sounds
- Envelopes and modulation
- Harmonic vs. inharmonic.
- Noisy
- Observing the spectra of real-world sounds

## TODO
- Plugins or instruments based on Additive Synthesis? FM Synthesis? AM Synthesis?
- Come up with some good stuff to listen to on this day

## Assignment
- Download SPEAR (It's free)
- Take two audio samples that are reasonably similar, e.g. a voice singing at 440 Hz and a bell ringing.
- See if you can modify one to make it a bit more like the other. What do you have to do? Change the envelope? The partials? Something else?
