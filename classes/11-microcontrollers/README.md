# Class 11
- Contact Microphones
- Transducers and feedback
- Arduino
- Reading sensors and getting the data into Max
- Scaling, cleaning, and normalizing data
- Debouncing and hysteresis

## TODO
- Find some great listening examples
- Investigate the Max for Live device package for integrating with this junk

## Listening
- [Leafcutter John Light Sensor Array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTvE0NqpAiE)

## Assignment
- Compose a piece for arduino and a single sensor. Could be a bend sensor, light sensor, range finder, temperature sensor, or something else entirely.
- Get the data into Max, then potentially send it along to Live or another DAW
