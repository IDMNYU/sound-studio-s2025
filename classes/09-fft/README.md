# Class 9
- Fourier transform
- FFT Parameters
- Reading a spectrogram
- FFT in Max
- Noise removal
- Spectral filtering
- Vocoding
- "Freeze" effect and phase vocoding
- True convolution
- Mutation/recombination
- "Rain" effect
- Wild games with phase vocoding

## TODO
- Find some cool IRCAM spectralist pieces to listen to?
- Listen to MP3s at different bitrates?

## Listening
- [Speaking Piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muCPjK4nGY4)

## Assignment
- Make some fun cross-synthesis using convolution
- Create a frozen sound "texture" using phase vocoding, then carve it out using a vocoder. Experiment with different source sounds.
- Save your favorite results and share them
