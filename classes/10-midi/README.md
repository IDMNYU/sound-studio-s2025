## Assignment
- Choose a controller and design a playable music system for it
- Use Max or a DAW of your choice to map controller inputs to sounds, samples, loops, and effects.
- Think about the different interface options available, and think about how you might want to map them
- Think about how you might organize a piece, remember that it's important for your instrument to be able to make loud and quiet sounds
- Give yourself time to experiment! A simple controller with more time to experiment will always sound better than a complex controller with no time to experiment.
