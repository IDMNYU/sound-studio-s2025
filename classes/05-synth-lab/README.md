# Class 5
- Head to the Synth Lab and mess around with a bunch of synthesizers. Maybe we actually meet in the synth lab.
- Learn to connect a guitar to an audio interface and get the sound into your computer
- See how to get that sound into Max and process it in real time.

## Assignment
- Even if you don't play guitar (especially if you don't play guitar?) build a composition around processing guitar audio in real time.
- You should head to the synth lab and use the equipment available there.
